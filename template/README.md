# Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# cordova setup
# first edit the project name in app/config.xml
cd app
yarn
cordova platform add ios
cordova platform add android
cordova platform add browser
```

## After setting up

Now it is time to build your web app. 
Just use it like using vue-cli 3. 
You will find it easy to use.

You can use `process.env.LINX_AGENT` to get which kind of devices is the user currently using. 
if you get `electron` , do things in standalone devices. 
if you get `cordova`, do things in mobile phones. 
if you get other answers or get nothing, mark it as in the web environment. 

If you wanna make some changes for electron, go to see `dist/electron.js` as the main part and `dist/renderer.electron.js` as the renderer part.
